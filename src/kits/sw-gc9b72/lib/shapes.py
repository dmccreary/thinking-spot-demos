# shapes.py -- the drawing commands the GC9A01 driver does not have.
#
# The OLED kit got ellipse(), poly(), and blit() for free, because the
# SSD1306 driver is built on MicroPython's framebuf module and framebuf
# ships those three compiled into the firmware.
#
# This driver is not built on framebuf. It talks to the glass directly,
# and it only knows how to draw pixels, horizontal runs, vertical runs,
# lines, rectangles, text, and raw buffers. Everything else -- every eye,
# every eyebrow arc, every mouth in this kit -- has to be built out of
# those. That is what this file is.
#
# Each function takes the display as its first argument, so a lab reads:
#
#     shapes.ellipse(display, 120, 100, 30, 24, WHITE, FILL)
#
# One rule shapes everything below: ON THIS DISPLAY, DRAWING IS SENDING.
# There is no buffer in RAM to scribble in. Every pixel you draw is bytes
# going down an SPI wire, and every separate drawing call costs a command
# sequence on top of the pixels. So these functions work in horizontal
# RUNS wherever they can -- one hline of forty pixels is far cheaper than
# forty calls to pixel(). Lab 31 measures exactly how much cheaper.
