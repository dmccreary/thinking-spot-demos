# Lab 25: Five Broken Faces -- Debugging
#
# Every face below is broken on purpose, each by one bug that real people
# make on this exact hardware all the time. Your job is to fix all five.
#
# Three of the five are different bugs from the OLED kit's version, and
# that is the lesson hiding inside the lesson: change the hardware and
# you change the bugs. There is no forgotten show() here, because there
# is no show(). What replaces it are two failures that display could
# never have: work that gets erased the instant after you draw it, and a
# face drawn perfectly onto glass you cannot see.
#
# Debugging is a skill, and it has a method. Guessing and editing random
# lines is not it. Do this instead, for each face:
#
#   1. READ the docstring. It says what the face is SUPPOSED to look like.
#   2. PREDICT what you think will happen before you press the button.
#   3. OBSERVE what actually happens, and describe the difference out loud
#      in one sentence: "it should smile but it frowns."
#   4. LOCATE the smallest piece of code that could cause that difference.
#   5. FIX one thing, then run it again. One change at a time -- if you
#      change three lines and it works, you have not learned which one
#      mattered.
#
# The symptom table at the bottom of this file is your lookup key. Try to
# solve each face before you read it.
#
# check-labs: allow-offscreen  -- bug 3 puts the eyes out where the corner
# of a rectangular display would be. On a 360x360 round screen that is two
# mistakes at once: part of each eye falls off the raster entirely, and
# what survives sits out at the rim where the bezel hides it.
# src/utils/check-labs.py must not report either as an accident.
#
# Button A goes to the next face, button B goes back. The bug number is
# also printed to the Thonny shell, which matters for bug 1 -- when the
# screen shows nothing at all, the shell is the only thing telling you the
# program is alive and doing what you asked.

# Things to try, once all five are fixed:
#
# 1. Break one on purpose in a NEW way and hand the file to a partner.
#    Writing a bug that produces a specific symptom proves you understand
#    the cause, not just the cure.
#
# 2. Write down the symptom you saw for each bug in your own words BEFORE
#    checking the table. Naming a symptom precisely is most of the work of
#    finding its cause.
#
# 3. Bug 3 is the round screen's signature bug, and it has a nasty
#    property: the same code on a RECTANGULAR display of the same 360x360
#    addressable area would look very nearly perfect, because there the
#    corners are real pixels you can see. Move BAD_EYE_X and BAD_EYE_Y
#    fifteen pixels at a time toward the center and note exactly where
#    each eye appears. config.inside_circle(45, 45) is False and
#    config.inside_circle(180, 45) is True -- somewhere between those two
#    is the edge you are hunting for.
#
# 4. Bug 5 is the only one you cannot see in a screenshot -- it is a bug
#    about TIME. Those are the hardest kind, which is why lab 26 builds a
#    tool for watching them.
