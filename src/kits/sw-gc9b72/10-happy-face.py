# Lab 10: Happy Face
# The first complete expression, built from three small functions --
# draw_eyes(), draw_eyebrows(), and a curved mouth. Later labs reuse this
# exact same pattern with different numbers to draw every other emotion.
#
# The numbers are bigger than the OLED kit's, and not by a simple factor.
# The OLED was 128 wide and 64 tall -- twice as wide as it was tall, so
# the face had to be squashed. This screen is square (and round), so the
# face finally gets to be face-shaped.
#
# Every constant below is the smartwatch kit's number multiplied by 1.5
# (360 / 240), which is also where face.py's numbers come from -- so the
# face this lab draws by hand and the face face.py draws for you in lab 23
# are the same face.

# Things to try:
#
# 1. Count how long the face takes to appear. Most of that is
#    display.fill(BLACK) -- 259,200 bytes of black, since 360 x 360 is
#    129,600 pixels at two bytes each. Comment it out and run twice in a
#    row to see how much faster the rest is on its own.
#
# 2. Move EYE_Y from 153 to 90. The eyes climb toward the rim and start
#    losing their outer edges to the bezel, because the screen gets
#    narrower the further you get from the middle.
