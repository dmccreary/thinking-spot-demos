# Lab 12: Winking with a Smile
# A closed eye is an arc -- the top half of an ellipse, drawn with
# quadrant mask TOP_HALF (3) instead of a full circle. Only one eye
# closes; the other stays open, which is what makes it read as a wink
# instead of a blink.
#
# Only the right eye changes between the two frames, so only the right
# eye's box gets erased and rebuilt. The left eye and the smile are drawn
# once and then left alone for as long as the program runs.

    sleep(2.5)             # normal face until the next wink

# Things to try:
#
# 1. The wink is now two small rectangles of work instead of two whole
#    screens. Add a print() of ticks_ms() around set_right_eye() and see
#    how little time a frame actually takes when you only redraw the part
#    that moved.
#
# 2. Close the LEFT eye instead. On a face, left and right are not
#    interchangeable -- most people read a left-eye wink as slightly
#    different in tone. Try it on a few people.
