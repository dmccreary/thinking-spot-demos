# Your First Face

This is the moment the kit has been building toward. Everything so far has been one shape at a
time; here they come together into an expression a stranger can read from across the room.

The whole face is three small functions — `draw_eyes()`, `draw_eyebrows()`, and a curved mouth.
Every later lab reuses this exact pattern with different numbers to draw every other emotion, so
it is worth understanding completely before you move on.

    Two eyes, two eyebrows, and one curve. That is the entire vocabulary — and it is enough to make somebody smile back at a machine. Every pixel tells a story!

## The Face Finally Gets To Be Face-Shaped

The numbers in this lab are bigger than the OLED kit's, and bigger again than the smaller 1.2"
smartwatch kit's — and neither jump is a simple "make it bigger." The OLED was 128 wide and 64
tall — twice as wide as it was tall — so its faces had to be squashed to fit. Both round screens are
square, so the proportions can stay honest; this one just has more of them.

| Feature | OLED kit | Smartwatch (1.2") | This kit (2.1") |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen | 128 × 64 rectangle | 240 × 240 circle | 360 × 360 circle |
| Eye spacing from center | 26 | 48 | 72 |
| Eye radius | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| Stroke width | 1 pixel | 4 pixels | 6 pixels |

That last row matters more than it looks. **One pixel is invisible on a screen this size.** Every
line and arc in this kit is drawn several times, a pixel apart, to thicken it — look for
`for offset in range(STROKE)` and you will see it everywhere from here on.

## Sample Program Code

Read the three drawing functions first, then look at how few lines it takes to combine them.

```py
# Lab 10: Happy Face

import config
import shapes

display = config.init_display()
WHITE = config.WHITE
BLACK = config.BLACK
NO_FILL = config.NO_FILL
FILL = config.FILL
BOTTOM_HALF = 12

HALF_WIDTH = config.WIDTH // 2
EYE_SPACING = 72
LEFT_EYE_X = HALF_WIDTH - EYE_SPACING
RIGHT_EYE_X = HALF_WIDTH + EYE_SPACING
EYE_Y = 153
PUPIL_RADIUS = 12

EYEBROW_HALF_WIDTH = 36
EYEBROW_Y = EYE_Y - 60

MOUTH_Y = 246

# One pixel is invisible on a screen this size, so lines and arcs get
# drawn several times, a pixel apart, to thicken them.
STROKE = 6


def draw_eye(x, rx, ry):
    shapes.ellipse(display, x, EYE_Y, rx, ry, WHITE, FILL)
    shapes.ellipse(display, x, EYE_Y, PUPIL_RADIUS, PUPIL_RADIUS, BLACK, FILL)


def draw_eyes(rx, ry):
    draw_eye(LEFT_EYE_X, rx, ry)
    draw_eye(RIGHT_EYE_X, rx, ry)


def draw_eyebrow(x, side, lift):
    # side: 1 for the left eyebrow (nose to the right), -1 for the right
    y = EYEBROW_Y - lift
    for offset in range(STROKE):
        display.line(x - EYEBROW_HALF_WIDTH * side, y + offset,
                     x + EYEBROW_HALF_WIDTH * side, y + offset, WHITE)


def draw_eyebrows(lift):
    draw_eyebrow(LEFT_EYE_X, 1, lift)
    draw_eyebrow(RIGHT_EYE_X, -1, lift)


def draw_mouth_curve(radius_x, radius_y, mask):
    for offset in range(STROKE):
        shapes.ellipse(display, HALF_WIDTH, MOUTH_Y - offset,
                       radius_x, radius_y, WHITE, NO_FILL, mask)


def draw_happy_face():
    display.fill(BLACK)
    draw_eyes(36, 36)
    draw_eyebrows(lift=8)
    draw_mouth_curve(75, 36, BOTTOM_HALF)


draw_happy_face()
```

Here's what that program draws on the display:

## Three Functions, One Face

Look at `draw_happy_face()`. It is four lines, and every one of them is a decision about feeling
rather than about pixels:

| Line | The decision it makes |
|---|---|
| `display.fill(BLACK)` | Start from a clean screen |
| `draw_eyes(36, 36)` | Round, relaxed eyes — not wide, not squashed |
| `draw_eyebrows(lift=8)` | Brows sitting slightly high, which reads as pleased |
| `draw_mouth_curve(75, 36, BOTTOM_HALF)` | A wide, gentle smile — mask 12 curves up |

That separation is the reason every emotion in this kit is only a handful of numbers away. Change
`36, 36` to `36, 18` and the same face looks annoyed. Change `BOTTOM_HALF` to `TOP_HALF` and it
looks disappointed.

!!! mascot-tip "The Wipe Is the Expensive Part"
    ![Pixel giving a tip](../../../img/mascot/tip.png){ class="mascot-admonition-img" }
    Count how long the face takes to appear. Most of that is `display.fill(BLACK)` — 259,200 bytes of black going down the wire, since 360 × 360 is 129,600 pixels at two bytes each. Comment it out, run twice in a row, and you will see how fast the face itself really is.

## Things to Try

1. **Time the wipe**, as in the tip above. Write the number down; it comes back in almost every
   animation lab.
2. **Move `EYE_Y` from 153 to 90.** The eyes climb toward the rim and start losing their outer
   edges to the bezel, because the screen gets narrower the further you get from the middle.
3. **Make it angry with three edits.** Change the eyes to `(36, 18)`, the lift to `-8`, and the
   mouth mask to `3`. Same functions, opposite mood.
4. **Add a catchlight** to each eye with `fill_rect()`, using the trick from the
   [pixel lab](../pixel/index.md). Two tiny white squares change how alive the face looks.
